# ds_Sai_Dhanush_R_N
## Project Description
This project involves a structured data science assignment where the goal was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), data processing, visualization, and summarization of insights using Python notebooks.

## Project Structure
- `notebook_1.ipynb`: Primary notebook containing data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- `csv_files/`: Folder containing all input datasets and intermediate processed data in CSV format.
- `outputs/`: Visual outputs including charts and graphs supporting the analysis.
- `ds_report.pdf`: Final report summarizing key findings and strategic recommendations.

## Objective
- Analyze the relationship between trading behavior (profitability, risk, volume, leverage) and market sentiment (fear vs greed).
- Identify hidden trends or signals that could lead to more informed and smarter trading strategies.
- Use exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and statistical techniques to reveal underlying patterns.
- Summarize insights in a comprehensive report, highlighting actionable takeaways for traders and analysts.

## Tools and Environment
- Python 3 with libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
- Google Colab as the primary interface for notebook execution.
- GitHub for file and project organization.

## Summary
This analysis provides valuable insights on how trading parameters respond to market emotional states, helping to uncover subtle signals that could improve trading decisions and risk management.
